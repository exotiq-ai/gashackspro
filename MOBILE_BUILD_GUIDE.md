# Gas Hacks - Mobile Build Guide

Complete guide for building and deploying Gas Hacks to iOS App Store and Google Play Store.

## Overview

Gas Hacks is built as a Progressive Web App (PWA) that can be converted to native iOS and Android apps using **Capacitor**. This approach allows us to maintain a single codebase while delivering native app experiences.

---

## Option 1: Progressive Web App (PWA) - Immediate Deployment

The app is already PWA-ready and can be installed directly from the browser!

### Features Already Implemented:
- ‚úÖ PWA manifest.json
- ‚úÖ Mobile-optimized viewport
- ‚úÖ App icons (192x192, 512x512, 180x180, 1024x1024)
- ‚úÖ Apple touch icons
- ‚úÖ Theme color meta tags
- ‚úÖ Standalone display mode

### How Users Install:
**iOS (Safari):**
1. Visit the Gas Hacks website
2. Tap the Share button
3. Select "Add to Home Screen"
4. App installs like a native app!

**Android (Chrome):**
1. Visit the Gas Hacks website
2. Tap the menu (3 dots)
3. Select "Add to Home Screen" or "Install App"
4. App installs like a native app!

### PWA Benefits:
- No app store approval needed
- Instant updates (no user action required)
- Smaller download size
- Works offline (with service worker)
- Cross-platform (one build for all)

## Option 2: Native Apps with Capacitor - App Store Distribution

For full App Store and Google Play distribution, use Capacitor to convert the web app to native.

### Prerequisites

**Required Software:**
- Node.js 18+ (already installed)
- Xcode 14+ (for iOS builds - Mac only)
- Android Studio (for Android builds)
- CocoaPods (for iOS dependencies)

**Install Capacitor:**
```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/ethanol-blend-calculator
pnpm add @capacitor/core @capacitor/cli
pnpm add @capacitor/ios @capacitor/android
```

### Step 1: Initialize Capacitor

```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/ethanol-blend-calculator
npx cap init "Gas Hacks" "com.gashacks.app" --web-dir=client/dist
```

### Step 2: Build the Web App

```bash
cd client
pnpm build
```

### Step 3: Add iOS Platform (Mac Required)

```bash
npx cap add ios
npx cap sync ios
npx cap open ios
```

This opens Xcode. From there:
1. Select your development team
2. Configure signing & capabilities
3. Add app icons in Assets.xcassets
4. Build and run on simulator or device

### Step 4: Add Android Platform

```bash
npx cap add android
npx cap sync android
npx cap open android
```

This opens Android Studio. From there:
1. Configure app signing
2. Add app icons in res/mipmap
3. Build APK or AAB for Play Store
4. Run on emulator or device
